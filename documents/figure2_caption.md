for figures heatmap_Group1_vs_Input, heatmap_Group3_vs_Input, heatmap_Group3_vs_Input

These figures are heatmaps showing the detail of fluxes of each reaction through each metabolite, compared to the in vitro case. Note that the flux differences here are typically higher than the fluxes we see in figure 1, because they are not normalized between groups and are multiplied by the reaction stoichiometry. We notice that Group 1 displays more polarized responses than Groups 2 and 3, this is simply because it has more in common with the control.

In Groups 1 and 2, we can see strong changes around phosphate and mannose metabolism. This is consistent with changes to cell growth and repair pathways. In Group 3, we see changes associated with the enzyme Phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide-transferase, which are more closely related to cell wall synthesis.
