for figures heatmap_Group1_vs_Input, heatmap_Group3_vs_Input, heatmap_Group3_vs_Input

These figures are heatmaps showing the detail of fluxes of each reaction through each metabolite, compared to the in vitro case. Note that the flux differences here are higher than the fluxes we see in figure 1, because they are unnormalized and are multiplied by the reaction stoichiometry.

In Group 1, we can see that the major changes around around handling of water and iron oxides, supporting our interpretation of figure 1. Furthermore, we can trace the interaction between thse components to an upregulation in the reaction FEROpp, representing ferroxidase, and controlled by the gene STM0168.

In Groups 2 and 3, we can see similar regulation of water and oxygen, but without similar behaviour around FEROpp. This once again shows that the differences between these groups are much more subtle than the behaviour of group 1.
