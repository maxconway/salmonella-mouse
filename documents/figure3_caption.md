for figures heatmap_Group1_vs_Group2, heatmap_Group1_vs_Group3, heatmap_Group2_vs_Group3

As in the previous heatmaps, these figures show a comparison of reactions rates and how they are rates interact via their associated metabolites. Once again, the difference is normalized but is based on a raw flux. This means that for each metabolite (i.e. row), the net flux difference is 0.

Of these heatmaps, the comparison between groups 2 and 3 is the most enlightening. We see higher CTP synthesis in Group 2 vs Group 3, but lower Cystein synthesis and Cytidylate kinase. We also see the changes in Phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide-transferase that noted previously, and they affect a number of reactions involved with cell envelope biosynthesis.
