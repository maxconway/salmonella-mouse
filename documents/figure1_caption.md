This figure shows the normalized rates for a number of reactions, selected for the high inter-group variance in their rates. Reaction abbreviations are used in place of reaction names for the sake of space, but a full list can be found in the appendicies. Note that the x scale has been subjected to cubic root scaling to highlight smaller changes. 

Normalization is against **Input**, which is the in vitro group, hence this value is always at 100%. Before selection and normalization, filtering was conducted to remove technical variation induced by the underdetermined nature of the system. This filtering was conducted by a monte-carlo approach, with reactions removed where they displayed a raw intra-group standard deviation of greater than 0.000001, or if they displayed a coefficient of variation of greater than 0.1% for the control group. 

The coloured bar shows the pathway annotations of eachreaction. The most obvious pattern is that in Histidine Metabolism, Cell Envelope Biosynthesis pathways are upregulated in Group 2 and Group 3, which are the cells that have been exposed to the immune system. We might hypothesize that these pathways are upregulated for some combination of repairing immune damage and a possible response to expose to an intracellular environment amenable to rapid proliferation. This pattern is also shown to a lesser extent in Tyrosine Tryptophan and Phenylalanine Metabolism, though in the reaction CTP synthase glutamine (CTPS2), Group 3 is not upregulated.

Other reactions and subsystems display a wider variety of behaviours, but we still see the clear and expected pattern that Groups 2 and 3 display more similarity to each other than to Group 1.
