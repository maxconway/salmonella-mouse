for figure horizontal_point_summary

This figure shows the normalized rates for a number of reactions, selected for the high variance in their rates. Normalization is against **Input**, which is the in vitro group, or against the mean absolute flux where **Input** was 0. Therefore **Input** is always at 0 or 1. We can see that most rates in group 3 are upregulated by about 15%, while most of the rates in groups 2 and 3 are upregulated by about 25%. We can also see that group 3 doesn't vary much. Groups 1 and 2 show more variance, with group 2 showing more variance within the typical range, but group 1 showing more extreme outliers.

Reactions abbreviations are used in place of reaction names for the sake of space, but a full list can be found in the appendicies. However, a few reactions are worthy of particular note. The reactions starting EX_ are exchange reactions, and we can see high levels of iron oxidation in group 1, among a number of other reactions that show high levels in group 1 and little or no activity in the other groups. These replace some of the reactions that are turned off in group 1. We also see replacements in group 2 of the reactions SO3R vs SULRi and DKMPPD vs DKMPPD3. These are changes in the use of Sulphite reductase and 2,3-diketo-5-methylthio-1-phosphopentane degredation.
